# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

1. Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard is looking to the future to see how many employees are retiring and how many employees are retiring from each position so that the company is prepared to know how many retirement packages they can expect to give and how many positions they can expect to fill.
Additionally the analysis identified which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

2. 1)There are 1,449 employees eligible to join the mentorship program, 
2)The number of employees retiring from each title is:
29414	Senior Engineer
28254	Senior Staff
14222	Engineer
12243	Staff
4502	Technique Leader
1761	Assistant Engineer
2	Manager
3) There are 90,398 total employees eligible for retirement
4) There are 45,397 engineers retiring this could be a sign that the company will need to target engineers primarily whether that be internal promotions or external hires.

3. There are currently 90,398 titles that are eligible to retire. 
  It appears that if you stick to the criteria of having mentors that are only born in the year 1965 then there are enough retirement eligible employees that can mentor them. This is due to the fact that there are 1,550 employees eligible for the mentorship program while there are 90,398 eligible retirees that can mentor them.
  I believe that you can extend the age requirement for the mentorship program to include older individuals that joined the company later. For example if you include individuals that were born in 1964 but joined the company in at 2000-01-01 or later it will include an additional 749 employees that can be mentored (see <https://github.com/JoePizz/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis./blob/main/mentor4.csv> for more info on the additional employees included for the mentorship program.)
